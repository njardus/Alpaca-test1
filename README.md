Alpha-Vantage-test1 is what it's called - a test to see how I can successfully set up the Alpha Vantage api. Once I've got a stable framework running, I'll rename.

For now, the plan is to get data downloaded, pump that data into a db, interpret the data to get a couple of basic calcs done, and then display it in a dashboard (maybe web based with (Flask).

A *lot* of this project is a learning exercise, so updates will definitely be slow and infrequent. And possibly broken.
